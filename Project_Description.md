# Project Description

Employers use interviews to judge your readiness and fit for the job, which includes hearing about your skills and interest in the role. The interview is not a test or exam, but a conversation between you and the employer. Build your own strategies to be prepared come interview day. This project is one of many ways for you to practice!

## Submission Instructions
1. [Find a job posting](https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/job-boards) that you would apply to now or after your Nanodegree graduation. Judge if you would be a good fit for the role. (Note: If you're more than 75% qualified for the job on paper, you're probably a good candidate and should give applying a shot!)
2. Answer the interview questions below as if you were answering them in an interview for that job.
3. **Copy and paste** the text of the job posting in "Notes to reviewer" during submission. Do not copy the job posting link, which can expire at any time.
4. Submit your interview questions as .pdf, text editor file, etc.

## Project: Answer the Following Interview Questions (6 total)
For each of the questions below, answer as if you were in an interview, explaining and justifying your answer with two to three paragraphs as you see fit. For coding answers, explain the relevant choices you made writing the code.

1. Describe a data project you worked on recently.
2. You are given a **ten piece** box of chocolate truffles. You know based on the label that six of the pieces have an orange cream filling and four of the pieces have a coconut filling. If you were to eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that the **first two** pieces you eat have an orange cream filling and the **last two** have a coconut filling?

Follow-up question: If you were given an identical box of chocolates and again eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that exactly **two** contain coconut filling?

3. Given the table `users`:

```
     Table "users"
+-------------+-----------+
| Column      | Type      |
+-------------+-----------+
| id          | integer   |
| username    | character |
| email       | character |
| city        | character |
| state       | character |
| zip         | integer   |
| active      | boolean   |
+-------------+-----------+
```

construct a query to find the top 5 states with the highest number of active users. Include the number for each state in the query result. Example result:

```
+------------+------------------+
| state      | num_active_users |
+------------+------------------+
| New Mexico | 502              |
| Alabama    | 495              |
| California | 300              |
| Maine      | 201              |
| Texas      | 189              |
+------------+------------------+
```

4. Define a function `first_unique` that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated (unique) character in the input string. If there are no unique characters return `None`. Note: Your code should be in Python.

```python
def first_unique(string):
 # Your code here
 return unique_char

> first_unique('aabbcdd123')
> c

> first_unique('a')
> a

> first_unique('112233')
> None
```
5. What are underfitting and overfitting in the context of Machine Learning? How might you balance them?
6. If you were to start your data analyst position today, what would be your goals a year from now?
